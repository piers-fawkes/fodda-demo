# Fodda API: Deterministic Mode

This document explains the **Deterministic Mode** of the Fodda Discovery Engine, a core feature for enterprise trust and reliability.

## 1. Concept: Grounded Retrieval
Deterministic Mode ensures that every response generated by the AI is strictly grounded in the knowledge graph. If the required information is not present in the graph, the system will not "hallucinate" or generate synthetic facts.

## 2. Technical Safeguards
- **NO_MATCH Fallback**: When the graph retrieval returns zero-confidence matches, the API returns a structured `NO_MATCH` code.
- **Evidence-First Prompting**: The orchestration layer is instructed to use *only* the provided evidence nodes.
- **Source Attribution**: Every fact in a deterministic response is linked to a permanent `ArticleID` or `TrendID`.

## 3. Benefits for Enterprise
- **Compliance**: Ensures responses stay within the bounds of approved data.
- **Auditability**: Every answer can be traced back to the original source material.
- **Predictability**: Consistent performance across similar query patterns.

## 4. How it Works
1. **Query Parsing**: The engine identifies the core entities and vertical.
2. **Graph Traversal**: Directed search in Neo4j for exact and semantically similar nodes.
3. **Filtering**: Non-relevant signals are discarded based on tenant-specific scores.
4. **Synthesis**: The LLM synthesizes the final answer using *only* the filtered nodes.
